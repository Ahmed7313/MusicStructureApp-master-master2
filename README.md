# Sounds for Kids

This app I have created to show my skills in using Audio in Android.
The app shows a list of animals and numbers using CustomAdapter
with caring for best Audio practices like voice duking and Audio focuse.

**This is how the app looks like**

# The goal of this project was to learn:


- Recycling the used views and using CustomAdapters with fragment

- inflate the layout with the views

-  Linking Activities together with a main Activity

- Using AudioManager and MediaPlayer classes for the best Audio 

- pause audio playback when lose audio focus

- Handle Activity life cycle  

# I have used through this project:

**ArrayList**

**CustomAdabter**

**ViewPager with Toolbar**

**AudioManager**

**MediaPlayer**

**AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener**

**Best practices to handle Audio lose focuse**
